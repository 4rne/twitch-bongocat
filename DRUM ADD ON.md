## New Drums in bongo cat 
This version added 4 drum sounds to the classic Bongo cat Sounds 
### How to use ?
Drums on this Keys
 * X - Base drum
 * C - Snare drum
 * B - Closed Hi-Hat
 * N - Open Hi-hat
### Why all this
Standard Bongo cat had just some random and too loud percussion sounds, but some keys are still usable on the keyboard, so I had to fill it!
### Why not all keys 
The last row of key are already used by other Bongo cat features like this:
 * Y as an alternative for Z conflict in DE and US layout.
 * V as lower Octave value for Bongo+
 * M as "Mau" sound in all versions
